# Task-3---Kinematics
firstly, the programme will ask if you want to preform forward kinematics or inverse kinematics.

Accodring to the choice made, the programme will ask for inputs through the serial monitor.

after the inputs are given through the serial monitor, the calculations will be done and the programme will display the rusults on the serial monitor and the servo motors will rotate to reach the desired end-point or the desired angels. 

NOTE: L1 and L2 are constatnts in this code ( 3 and 6 repectively ), however, this could be easily modified to make L1 and L2 entered by the user.
